A BetterDiscord Plugin that adds a button that puts the mention for the channel clicked in your message, like Discord does for users.

When you click on a channel, there will be a button called "Mention"

This button will add a mention like #channel to your current message

The button will not show if you cannot type in your current channel

This also works on voice channels and threads
